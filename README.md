# Terra-React-Native

Depending on your dev workflow:
- Expo: use `expo-web-browser` from https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser/
- React native with iOS / Android manual management: use `react-native-inappbrowser-reborn` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-inappbrowser-reborn

This repo has a demo for `expo-web-browser`
